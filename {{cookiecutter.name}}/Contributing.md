There are many ways of contributing. Contributions are greatly appreciated. 

If you feel intimidated at contributing towards this project, you can consider editing these Wiki pages to begin with. These don't require any programming knowledge, and will take the fear of contributing to another repository out immediately. 

If you would like to contribute code, please consider creating a new branch, and sending a pull request. If you are unfamiliar, please refer to the tutorials [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request). This code follows a particular modular structure. It is detailed [here](./Structure-of-the-repo). Please consider going through that section before submitting code. 

Ideally you would want to contribute new libraries, which would typically go into the [`src/lib`](../tree/master/src/lib) folder. If you do create a library, please also consider contributing a Jupyter notebook within the [`notoebooks`](../tree/master/notebooks) folder that describe how to use the library. You are welcome to take inspiration from existing libraries and Notebooks.
